The following CSS code causes unexpected behavior in some browsers because of the lack of specificity in selectors:

```css
div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

The browser might apply both styles, leading to unexpected color rendering. The specificity of `div p` and `p` are equal in some scenarios.
