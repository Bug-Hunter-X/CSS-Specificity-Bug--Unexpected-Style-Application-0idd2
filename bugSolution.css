To fix this, we need to increase the specificity of the selector to ensure it overrides the more generic selector. One approach is to add an extra class to the div:

```css
.container div p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
```

This increases the specificity and ensures that `color: blue` is applied correctly only where intended.
